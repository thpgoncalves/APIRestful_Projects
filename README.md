# Notes Web Restful - PTBR

Essa é uma aplicação web que utiliza os conceitos de REST, onde é um 'site' para poder fazer e gerenciar notas e guardar links. 

Dentro das funcionalidades, há a possibilidade de pesquisa, do uso de filtros para organizar as notas entre outras aplicações.

De início o usuário precisa se cadastrar, criando um login para poder acessar sua página. Todos os cadastros de usuários, cadastros de notas e outras ações que usem dados são registrados no banco de dados.

Foram utilizadas tecnologias de criptografia para armazenar dados sensíveis como senhas e tokens de autenticação e diversos outros conceitos e tecnologias que podem ser explorados olhando nos arquivos.

**Desenvolvido com**:
- Node no Backend 
- React no Frontend.


# Notes Web Restful - EN

This is a web application that uses REST concepts, where it is a 'site' for making and managing notes and saving links. 

Its functionalities include the possibility of searching, using filters to organize notes and other applications.

To begin with, the user needs to register, creating a login to access the page. All user registrations, grade registrations and other actions that use data are recorded in the database.

Encryption technologies were used to store sensitive data such as passwords and authentication tokens and various other concepts and technologies can be explored by looking at the files.

**Developed with**:
- Node on the Backend 
- React on the Frontend.


## Project Structure:
To make it easier to upgrade and maintain the code in the future, the REST architecture was adopted:

## Screenshots:

### Game Mode

Above is an example of using the Casino Experience mode, where the player chooses between the possible moves and plays against the Dealer.

### Simulation Mode
![Simulation Mode](./Blackjack/img/simulation_mode.png)

Above is an example of using the Simulation Mode, which simulates 100,000 games based on the strategies described in the files and returns the most important statistics.

### Hard Hand

Above is the diagram on which the strategy for playing all the possible Hard Hands combinations was based.

### Soft Hand
![Soft Hand](./Blackjack/img/soft_hand.jpg)

Above is the diagram on which the strategy for playing all the possible Soft Hands combinations was based.

### Pairs
![Pairs](./Blackjack/img/Pairs.jpg)

Above is the diagram on which the strategy for playing all the possible Pairs combinations was based.

## Future Improvements for next versions:

- Use of supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms to test other possible strategies and maximize the win rate of specific hands
- Implementation of bankroll and betting logics
